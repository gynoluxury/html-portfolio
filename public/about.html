<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Antoinette "Ant T" Terrell, a passionate Front End Web Developer with a knack 
  for crafting engaging and user-friendly web experiences. With expertise in HTML, CSS, 
  and JavaScript, I love bringing designs to life and creating seamless, dynamic 
  interfaces that captivate users. I'm currently expanding my skill set into back-end 
  web development, diving deeper into the world of full-stack creation with enthusiasm

  and pushing the boundaries of what's possible on the web. Each project I take on is an 
  opportunity to blend creativity with technical precision, delivering solutions that are
   both functional and visually appealing.
