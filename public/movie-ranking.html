   <h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All Time</h2>

<h3>Men of Honor</h3>
<p>Cuba Gooding Jr did such an amazing job displaying courage and the will to fight 
   by any means necessary. It's truly an inspiration to all who see it.</p>
<h3>Self Made: Madam C. J. Walker</h3>
<p>Another great inspirational story from someone that refuses to give up, even when life 
   throws all kind of curve balls. I get pumped up excited watching this "limited series".
</p>
<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>Yes, it's true! I love this movie, even though it's 3 hours long! I could watch it again and again.
   Ever time I see itt, I cry! Like who doesn't like Titanic, right?
